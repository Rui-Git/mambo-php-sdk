# Mambo php SDK


This is not an official product. For the sake of my developpement, I've took the current version of the SDK to generate a composer compatible project.

This project will not be supported when Mambo.io will release theire own version.

You can get more information on Mambo here https://mambo.io

## Requirements

PHP 5.3.0 and later.

## Composer

You can install the bindings via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Run the following command:

```bash
composer require rui-git/mambo-php-sdk
```

To use the bindings, use Composer's [autoload](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#autoloading):

```php
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');
```

## Dependencies

The bindings require the following extension in order to work properly:

- [`curl`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php), although you can use your own non-cURL client if you prefer
- [`json`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.json.php)

If you use Composer, these dependencies should be handled automatically. If you install manually, you'll want to make sure that these extensions are available.
